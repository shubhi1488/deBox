            Indian-born business executive who was CEO of the computer software company Microsoft (2014– ). 
            Nadella grew up in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad and studied electrical engineering at Mangalore University (B.Sc., 1988) <br>  
            Satya Nadella's story is inspiring to all generations. Satya Nadella didn't build an enterprise himself.
             He worked hard to achieve this success. He was selected to run an existing large enterprise depending on his past work and leadership skills.

Nobody cares what degrees you've got or from which college or university you've graduated from. 
The only thing that matters is what you can give to the company. The company only cares about your ability to do the job and in Satya Nadella's case, 
Microsoft had 22 years to evaluate that. People admire Satya Nadella for his positive leadership skills and empathy towards the employees which have made him the best CEO to work with.
